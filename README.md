# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

git clone into a folder on your computer. Then enter the command npm install.

Node and NPM are necessary to run the React application. 

### Installing Node and NPM on Windows
Go to the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download and install the LTS version. This will also install NPM.

### Installing Node and NPM on Mac
First install NVM. Then enter the commands nvm install --lts and nvm alias default node. Doing so will also install NPM.

## Running this Application
1. Run npm start.
2. Open the file ExamplePage.html in a browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
This is required to run the React app, which is in an iframe in ExamplePage.html.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Right now there are no tests. \
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
